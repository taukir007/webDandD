# 🌐 webDandD — Daily Web Development & Design Journey

**webDandD** is my personal learning archive where I upload my **daily progress** as I study **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Design**.  
Each day has its own folder, and whenever possible, the folder contains an `index.html` file that demonstrates the work done on that day.

This repository is connected to **GitHub Pages**, allowing anyone to browse and preview my work live.

## 📅 Repository Structure

webDandD/
├── Day 1 - HTML/
│ └── index.html
├── Day 2 - HTML/
│ └── index.html
├── Day 3 - HTML/
│ └── practice.html
├── Day 4 - CSS/
│ └── index.html
└── ...

- Each folder represents **one day of learning**.
- If a folder has an `index.html`, GitHub Pages will show it as a **live webpage**.
- If not, GitHub Pages will show the **folder listing**.

## 🌍 Live Demo Website

A custom `index.html` at the root automatically fetches all folders and lists them on the website.

🔗 **Live Site:**  
https://taukir007.github.io/webDandD/


The website will:
- Auto-detect new **Day X** folders
- List each day with a preview button
- Show the day's `index.html` inside a live **iframe preview**
- If no `index.html`, it provides a GitHub directory link
